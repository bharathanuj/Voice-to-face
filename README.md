# Speech-to-face

<p>
Extracting features such as Age, Gender of a person from his voice is a well studied and logically acceptable research domain built on the basis of human perciverence.Human brain constructs a face on hearing a person’s voice making it relevant to experiment reconstructing faces from voices.</p>
 <p> Growing cyber crimes  such as impersonation and scam calls induce the need for generating faces from voice.Although its impossible to generate an instantaneous face of a person from their voice it is possible to reconstruct a generic face of the person which has enough information for person re-identification. 
  </p> <p>In this project , we design and train a generative adversarial network which is capable of reconstructing faces from voice while preserving identity of the person and charactistics extractable from a person’s voice such as gender and age.
